Each folder denotes the name of a tutorial project.
Inside each folder should be exactly 2 sub-folders:

Named:
1: "Failed"
2: "Solution"

The idea:
After failing hard at getting a tutorial to work, create a directory for it
here and put the code in the Failed folder. Then at some time try to clone
the project into the "solution" folder and fix it.

Could make for excellent debugging excercises.

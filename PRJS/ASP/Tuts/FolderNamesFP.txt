F is for "Fail"
These are projects I did that failed to run or compile for some reason.

P is for "Pass"
These are projects I did that I was able to get up and running without
any trouble.


Failed projects always stay in failed folder.
If you have a solution to a failed project, it
also goes in the F (Fail) folder. So we can keep
a record of common mistakes and their solutions.
